 # Mobile App Automation Testing Playground  

This project was built using **Lovable**, a no-code development tool.  
The goal of this project is to explore **mobile app automation testing with Appium**, focusing on both **functional testing** and **visual testing** for mobile applications.  

Since the app is a **web app**, it can be packaged into an **APK** for installation on a device or emulator using **Capacitor**.
